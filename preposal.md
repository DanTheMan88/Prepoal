# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Wave Finder
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
I will create a program that will hopfully find a surfspot that I have been trying to manually find for the past 5 years. Else I will create a program that makes a random roadtrip. The user will only need to input a set amount of days
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
I have applied to use a special software that allows me to mod google earth. This hill hopfully help my create a bot that will look for a certain wave that lives in a 20km bay. The waveis on the atlatic and is in the souther hemisphere. Every spot that mathes the description will be marked and I will look through the spots manually.
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A bot that can do somthing on google earth. I will accomplish making a mod for google earth.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A bot that partially can search for somthing like a wave.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A bot on google earth that can find this dream wave.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For this project I would hope to make a bot that can can the boarders between land and ocean. By doing this it will look for a wave with certain criterias. So far I have applied for access to a google program that will allow me to code for google earth and mod it. Once I get past this step I will start to manipulate the program learning how it works. After this I will need to research how to bot google earth. This is the part that worries me.
